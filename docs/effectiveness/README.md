# Effectiveness
## Introduction
"Effectiveness" concerns with the broad principles of effective action, often drawing from specific cases, experiences and/or pursuits. But "effectiveness" also concerns with broad principles within particular fields (e.g. programming, writing, etc.), which may be applicable more widely but are not necessarily so. In this directory, I aim to write about, discuss and explore such principles of effectiveness, both general and area-specific.

**NOTE**: _Philosophy, if practiced rightly, is essentially the study of effective thought and action at the broadest and most fundamental cognitive levels. Hence, I shall include links to the philosophy section of my website as well._

In essence, the primary goal of life is to be effective, i.e. to:

- Strive and achieve values
- Do so consistently and reliably
